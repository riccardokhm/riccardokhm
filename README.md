### Vision
![My research framework](Images/Framework.png)
<br/>
<br/>
I build digital systems based on a tricentric view of industrial processes, where humans, machines, and digital assets continuously interact and co-evolve. My work sits at the intersection of XR, computer graphics, AI/ML, and engineering data, focusing on transforming CAD, geometry, and process knowledge into actionable, human-centric tools. I’m particularly interested in how simulation, data-driven models, and intelligent interfaces can bridge physical factories and human experience through a coherent digital layer. Curiosity—technical and personal—drives how I explore, prototype, and connect these domains.
